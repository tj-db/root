      <p>A long time ago, there was a boy named <strong>Aladdin</strong>.</p>
      <p>He was poor and lived with his mother.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>One day, a strange old man spoke to Aladdin and said:</p>
      <p class="quote">?Do you want to have lots and lots of money??</p>
      <p>He took Aladdin to a cave.</p>
      <p class="quote">?Inside this cave is lots of money and a magic lamp.?</p>
      <p class="quote">?Go inside and bring me the lamp!?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Aladdin found the lamp, but he wanted to keep it.</p>
      <p>The old man got angry and closed the cave!</p>
      <p>Aladdin was stuck!</p>
      <p>He was scared and sat down.</p>
      <p>He rubbed the lamp?</p>
      <p><strong>POOF!</strong></p>
      <p>A magic genie came out of the lamp!</p>
      <p class="quote">?I will give you three wishes.?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Aladdin used the first wish to go home.</p>
      <p class="quote">?I wish to go home.?</p>
      <p>Then he used a wish to become rich.</p>
      <p class="quote">?I wish I had lots of money.?</p>
      <p>Aladdin met the princess and they fell in love.</p>
      <p>They got married and were very happy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But the old man came back.</p>
      <p>He stole the lamp!</p>
      <p>Now the old man had 3 wishes.</p>
      <p class="quote">?I wish I had all the money in the world.?</p>
      <p>But it didn?t make him happy, so he wished:</p>
      <p class="quote">?I wish the princess loved me, not Aladdin.?</p>
      <p>But the genie said:</p>
      <p class="quote">?Sorry, I can?t do that! Their love is too strong!?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Angry, the old man threw the lamp and the genie out the window!</p>
      <p>But Aladdin found the lamp.</p>
      <p>He used his last wish and said:</p>
      <p class="quote">?I wish the old man was a frog!?</p>
