導言：

學生們充滿活力、好奇心，並真誠地渴望學習與成長。
他們正在建立堅實的基礎，這不僅將支持他們進入下一個學習階段，更將在未來許多年中發揮作用。

雙語能力為學生開啟許多大門，不僅在學術與職場上，在文化與社交層面上也是如此，無論在本地或國際上皆然。

這項能力需要長時間的努力與投入才能培養，但我毫不懷疑，這筆投資絕對值得。

Introduction:

The students are full of energy, curiosity, and a genuine eagerness to learn and grow.

They are building a strong foundation, one that will support them not only in the next phase of their education but for many years to come. 

Bilingualism opens doors, not only academically and professionally, but also culturally and socially, both locally and abroad.

This skill may take years of hard work and dedication but I have no doubt the investment is well worth it.

整體評語：

語言學習的關鍵在於積極參與。

光是聆聽與做筆記是不夠的——學生需要勇於提問、發表意見，並積極參與課堂活動。

這些學生正站在一段漫長旅程的起點，我非常期待看到他們憑藉持續的好奇心、努力與勇氣，能走得多遠。

General Comments:

Language learning thrives on engagement. 

It’s not enough to simply listen and take notes—students need to ask questions, speak up, and participate actively. 

These students are at the start of a long journey, and I’m excited to see how far they will go with their continued curiosity, effort, and courage.
